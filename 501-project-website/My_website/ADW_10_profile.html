            About me
        </h2>
        <p>
          1. Hi everyone, my name is Yifei Wu. I'm excited to meet you all and spend the next couple of years collaborating and learning from each other! I was in Ohio State during my undergraduate study.  My major during undergraduate is Mathematics and statistics. I am really interested in the Data Analytic and I want to be a data scientist or other data-related jobs to create social impact.  I have learned Python and little part of computer vision & machine learning. I hope I can learn few career-related fairs  through this program in order to step into a much higher platform. I will focus myself on the field of Data or Finance industries in the near feature. In my daily life, I am interested in basketball, photography, hiking and traveling.
          2. For now, I still have no confirmed topic for my project. Due to I am interested in sport data analysis and social media datasets.  As more and more people have involved in the social media and it has been the increasing trend, I will probably take such sort of topic.

          3. For me Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions. Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization’s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.

          4. In my opinion, the main difference can be considered in several parts.

          (1). Data science story contains more plots and data visualization which is more easily understood by people who don’t have technical background compared with a technical report. 

          (2). The target audience are probably different. The technical report tends to being focused by those who works in such technical fields.However, data science stories can be consumed by any kind of reader, regardless of their knowledge background and their career.
